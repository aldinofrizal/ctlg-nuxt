CTLG-nuxt is a simple mockup application to show products catalogue and product detail. CTLG-nuxt use data source form faker-api and images from shutterstock, which coupled to be a json database using https://my-json-server.typicode.com/ , because its free plan limit, only 10 row data can be uploaded and hosted. There is a review column in product detail page, which use dummy data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ 

As its name, CTLG-NUXT uses Nuxt as a main framework. API connection using axios module which integrated with Nuxt https://axios.nuxtjs.org/ . CTLG-NUXT was built without using css framework, and vue component framework like bootstrap, material ui, etc. I use css pre-processor sass, to facilitate css class creation which make it easier.
